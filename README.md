# Maze runner backend

## Description

This is the backend for https://github.com/Lennartstachowiak/maze-runner-website.
Here the user authentication and authorisation is handled, the maze and user data is managed, the data is handled with the database, algorithms are executed and mazes are generated.

# Getting Started

You can run the programm locally in two different ways.

- Running with **Docker** (recommended)
- Running with **Python**

## Running with **Docker** (recommended)

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**
  - It is a platform that allows you to package, distribute, and run applications using containers.

### Installation

To use Docker with this project, you'll need to have Docker installed on your system. If you haven't installed Docker yet, follow these steps:

1.  Visit the Docker website: https://www.docker.com

2.  Download the installer for your operating system (e.g., Docker Desktop for Windows, Docker Desktop for macOS, Docker Engine for Linux).

3.  Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

4.  Once the installation is complete, start the Docker application.

        ðŸ’¡ For detailed installation instructions and   system requirements, please refer to the official Docker documentation.

### Setting up the environment

You need to create a `.env` file in the root directory and need to add some PostgreSQL data for the database:

- `POSTGRES_USER=your_username`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password`
- `POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name`

Furthermore you also need to add to `.env`

- `SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key`

This key will be used for encryption of sessions and cookies.

### Running the application

In root directory run:

`docker compose up`

This command will set up everything for you automatically.

**Now you are ready to go!**

## Running with **Python**

### Prerequisites

- Python
- pip

### Installation

Check out the official website of python (https://www.python.org/) to install python for your operating system.

### Flask

#### In root directory (if `venv`` already exist skip to step 3):

1. Create a virtual enviorment (venv) -> `python3 -m venv venv`

2. Start venv with -> `source venv/bin/activate`

3. Install packages for virtual enviorment -> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. For flask commands set flask with -> `export FLASK_APP=run`

### Create database

Migration should already pre set the database

If not run this command:

- `flask db init`

To create the database locally use:

- `flask db migrate -m 'init'`

- `flask db upgrade`

This will create a file called: database.db

### Scripts to set up the database data

`python3 -m scripts.addDummyDataMazeDB`

### Start project

`docker compose up`

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### Start development environment:

`docker compose up`

#### Delete all algorithms for all users:

`python3 -m scripts.deleteAlgorithms`

#### Delete all mazes:

`python3 -m scripts.deleteMazes`
